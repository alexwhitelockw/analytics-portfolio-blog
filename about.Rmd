title: "About this blog"
description: |
  I am a research fellow in learning analytics at Monash University. My research interests include the application of learning analytics to explore information seeking behaviour, and the application of psychometric methods to evaluate established survey instruments. I'll be using this blog to present various analytical techniques on data using both R and Python, in addition to some posts related to my research.
